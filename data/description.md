# Data
Store your datasets in this directory. A subdirectory structure that has
worked well is as follows:

```
- data
    - dataset1
        - X.npy
        - Y.npy
    - dataset2
        - X.npy
        - Y.npy
    ... etc
```

The `data` directory has been added to the .gitignore file so that your data
will not be tracked by git and accidentally pushed to Github's remote
repo copy.
