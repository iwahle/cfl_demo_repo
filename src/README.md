Code to actually run `cfl` should go here. This example includes a jupyter
notebook that runs CFL (could be a Python script instead). It also includes a
`params.py` file, where all path and parameter specifications are stored 
to 1) keep the notebook cleaner and 2) encourage reproducibility and easy
tracking of what parameters were used through git. (Note that CFL will save
the parameters used in the generated `experiment000x/params` directory as well,
so it is not necessary to track these separately, just convenient if you
are performing many CFL runs).
